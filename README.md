## Flow

### Create a Web DID

- First User will need a domain setup for which you want to create a did.
- User will also need a ssl certificate setup for the same domain.
- User certificate chain should be accessible at your provided url else system will fetch from "https://your-domain/.well-known/x509CertificateChain.pem" or "https://domain/tenant/x509CertificateChain.pem"
- The create did api will make a did.json for the provided domain name.
- User will have to host this did.json on "https://your-domain/.well-known/did.json" or "https://domain/tenant/did.json"

### Verify a Web DID
- User need to provide web did, verification method and private key for verify
- System will resolve did.json from provided did
- System will find provided verification method in did.json
- System will sign sample text with private key
- After that system will verify sample text hash with verification method
- System will share result of verification

- System will fetch all depended vcs 
- System will sign vcs
- System will also verify signature with verification method
- System will req for compliance credentials with all vcs
- Compliance service will response with compliance credential

### Verify a Self Description and Compliance Credential
- User will request with vc url and policies
- System will validate vc type with allowed types (gx:LegalParticipant,gx:ServiceOffering,gx:VirtualDataResource,gx:PhysicalResource,gx:VirtualSoftwareResource) 
- System will validate policy with allowed policies (integrityCheck,issuerSignature,complianceSignature,complianceCheck,complianceExpired)
- After that system will check each policy individually
- System will share result of verification

### Label Level VC and Compliance
- Users will request the API service for creating service offering in wizard along with label level data.
- API service will create unsigned VC JSON for label level by adding required data and requests Signer Tool Service for,
        <ol>
            <li> Label level calculation</li> 
            <li> Self Sign VC (unsigned â†’ signed)</li> 
        </ol>
- Once the VC is signed, Signer Tool Service  will request Compliance service for compliance.
- Once the compliance is done, Signer tool service will respond to API Service with Signed VC & Compliance Data.
- API Service will create a resolvable link using this label level data and store it in the DB.
